A tool to identify high cost resources in GCP at a granular level

## Prerequisites

* You must have [Billing export for BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/export-data-bigquery) enabled

* You must be authorized to create BigQuery jobs

* It is highly recommended that resources be labelled at a granular level. The granularity of the labels will be reflected in the results.

## Installation

    npm install -g

## Usage

Execute `gcp-accountant` and answer the questions:

    $ gcp-accountant
    ? What is the billing dataset called? (Use arrow keys)
    ‚ùØ billing
      not-billing
      not-billing-either
    [..]

## How it works

First, `gcp-accountant` makes use of [inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) and the [Google BigQuery Client Library for Node.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@google-cloud/bigquery) to gather some info from the user:

1. The name of the billing dataset
2. The name of the billing table
3. The invoice month to perform cost analysis on in `YYYYMM` format

Then `gcp-accountant` runs queries on the data by means of the aforementioned BigQuery client and the results are then displayed in the terminal by means of [cliui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cliui) and [chalk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk).
